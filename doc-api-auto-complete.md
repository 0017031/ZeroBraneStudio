title: Adding API and auto-complete description
---

ZeroBrane Studio supports custom API definitions that are used in providing information for auto-complete and tooltip functions.

By providing a description for `io.open`, users may not only see `open` suggested after typing `io.`, but also see a description for this function after they type `io.open(` or when they request a tooltip for `io.open(...)`.

## API definition format

API definitions are stored in the form of Lua files that return a table of the following structure:

{% highlight lua %}
{
  foo = {
    type = "lib",
    description = "this does something",

    -- function/methods:
    args = "(blah,blubb)",
    returns = "(foo)",

    -- children in the class hierarchy
    childs = { -- recursive
      bar = {
        type = "function",
        description = "this does something",
        valuetype = "mytype",
      }
    }
  },

  baz = {
    type = "value",
    --...
  },
}
{% endhighlight %}

This structure defines a value `baz`, a library `foo`, and a function in that library `foo.bar()` that returns a value with type `mytype`.

Possible type values are:

- `function`: to describe a function that accepts parameters (`args`) and returns values (`returns`), possibly of a specific type (`valuetype`).
- `class` and `lib`: to describe groups of functions, methods, values, and other classes and libraries.
- `keyword`: to describe language keywords, like `do` and `end`.
- `value`: to describe specific values;
- `method`: to describe method calls; methods are described similar to functions and also accept arguments and return values and value types. The only difference is that methods are only suggested after `:` in auto-complete, while functions are suggested after `.` and `:`.

When `valuetype` is specified for a `method` or a `function`, it is used for autocomplete type guessing.
If the value is used in an expression, then the variable this value is assigned to is treated as having the value type;
e.g. if `somefunc` has `valuetype` of `math`, then after `test = somefunc()`, typing `test.` will be treated as `math.` in autcomplete logic.

## How to reference API definitions

API definitions can be referenced by name in interpreter files as part of the `api` table.
For example, `interpreters/luadeb.lua` file references `wxwidgets` and `baselib` API definitions, which can be found in files `api/lua/wxwidgets.lua` and `api/lua/baselib.lua`.

{% highlight lua %}
return {
  name = "Lua",
  description = "Lua interpreter with debugger",
  api = {"wxwidgets","baselib"},
  ...
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure to use exactly the same name when you reference files with API definitions even on case-insensitive systems.
If you name the file `api/lua/BaseLib.lua`, but reference it as `'baselib'`, the link won't work.

## Example

{% highlight lua %}
return {
  -- I/O library
  io = {
    type = "lib",
    description = "The I/O library provides two different styles for file manipulation. The first one uses implicit file descriptors; that is, there are operations to set a default input file and a default output file, and all input/output operations are over these default files. The second style uses explicit file descriptors.\n\nWhen using implicit file descriptors, all operations are supplied by table io. When using explicit file descriptors, the operation io.open returns a file descriptor and then all operations are supplied as methods of the file descriptor.\n\nThe table io also provides three predefined file descriptors with their usual meanings from C: io.stdin, io.stdout, and io.stderr. The I/O library never closes these files.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all I/O functions return nil on failure (plus an error message as a second result and a system-dependent error code as a third result) and some value different from nil on success.",
    childs = {
      stdin = { type = "value" },
      stdout = { type = "value" },
      stderr = { type = "value" },
      open = {
        type = "function",
        description = "This function opens a file, in the mode specified in the string mode.\n\nIt returns a new file handle, or, in case of errors, nil plus an error message.\n\nThe mode string can be any of the following:\n\n* \"r\": read mode (the default);\n\n* \"w\": write mode;\n\n* \"a\": append mode;\n\n* \"r+\": update mode, all previous data is preserved;\n\n* \"w+\": update mode, all previous data is erased;\n\n* \"a+\": append update mode, previous data is preserved, writing is only allowed at the end of file.\n\nThe mode string can also have a 'b' at the end, which is needed in some systems to open the file in binary mode.",
        args = "(filename: string [, mode: string])",
        returns = "(file|nil [, string])",
        valuetype = "f", -- indicates that io.open returns value of type `f`
      },
    },
  },

  f = {
    type = "class",
    description = "Pseudoclass for operations on file handles.",
    childs = {
      close = {
        type = "method",
        description = "Closes file.\n\nNote that files are automatically closed when their handles are garbage collected, but that takes an unpredictable amount of time to happen.\n\nWhen closing a file handle created with io.popen, file:close returns the same values returned by os.execute. RETURN SPECIAL CASE ADDED IN Lua 5.2.",
        args = "(file: file)",
        returns = "(boolean|nil [, string, number])",
      },
    },
  },
}
{% endhighlight %}

This generates the following description for `io.open`: `(file|nil [, string]) io.open (filename: string [, mode: string])`.

When `io.open` is used in an expression, its return value gets the value of `valuetype` `f` (in this particular case), which allows auto-complete to suggest values, functions, and methods defined for that class:

{% highlight lua %}
local foo = io.open("myfile")
foo:
{% endhighlight %}

After typing `foo:`, the user will get `close` as an option. Since it is described as `method`, rather than `function`, it will not be suggested after typing `foo.`.
