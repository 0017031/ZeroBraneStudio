## What does the bluish line underlying some names mean?

It identifies function calls. 
You can [disable it](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/user-sample.lua#L98),
[change its type](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/user-sample.lua#L104),
or [change its color](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/user-sample.lua#L101).

## How to specify a directory my script should be executed in for `require` commands to work?

You can set the [project folder](doc-getting-started.html#project_folder), which will be used to set the current folder when your application is run or debugged.

## How to change background color in the editor?

You can put `styles.text.bg = {240,240,240}` in `cfg/user.lua`. See the [example](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/user-sample.lua).

## Why stepping into function calls doesn't work in some cases?

You need to have a file opened in the IDE before you can step into functions defined in that file.
You can also configure the IDE to [auto-open files](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/user-sample.lua#L71) for you.

## Is it possible to debug dynamic fragments loaded with `loadstring()`?

Yes; you can specify a filename as the second parameter to `loadstring` and have that file in your project directory with the same content as what's loaded with `loadstring`.
You can then open that file in the IDE or configure it to auto-open it for you.

## Is debugging of Lua 5.2 applications supported?

Starting from v0.35 the debugging of Lua 5.2 applications is supported out-of-the-box.
You can set your Lua interpreter to point to a Lua 5.2 executable (`path.lua = [[d:/path/to/lua52.exe]]`) and as long as you have luasocket compiled with Lua 5.2, you should be able to debug Lua 5.2 applications.
Note that the internal Lua engine in ZeroBrane Studio is still Lua 5.1 and you will not be able to compile any code that uses Lua 5.2 features (like goto statements).
To work around that you can copy the existing Lua interpreter (`interpreters/luadeb.lua` into a different file) and add `skipcompile = true,` option to it, which will skip a required compilation step before executing your script.

## How to accept keyboard input for applications started from the IDE?

Simply make sure that you "print" something using `print` or `io.write` before reading the input.
You will see a prompt in the Output window where you can enter your input.

## Where is the configuration file stored?

This is covered in the description of system [configuration](doc-configuration.html).

## How to modify a key mapping?

To modify a key mapping for a particular menu item, you can add the following command to your [configuration](doc-configuration.html):
`local G = ...; keymap[G.ID_STARTDEBUG] = "Ctrl-Shift-D"`.
This will modify the default shortcut for `Program | Start Debugging` command.

See an [example in user-sample.lua](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/cfg/user-sample.lua#L18),
the description for possible [accelerator values](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/src/editor/keymap.lua#L4),
and the full list of IDs in [src/editor/keymap.lua](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/src/editor/keymap.lua).

## How do I restore default configuration for recent files, projects, and editor tabs?

You can **remove the configuration file** ZeroBrane Studio is using to store these settings.
The location (and the name) of this file is system dependent:
it is located in `%HOME%\ZeroBraneStudio.ini` on Windows,
`$HOME/Library/Preferences/ZeroBraneStudio Preferences` on Mac OSX, and in
`$HOME/.ZeroBraneStudio` on Linux. 
You can see the location of the HOME directory if you type `wx.wxGetHomeDir()` into the Local console.
