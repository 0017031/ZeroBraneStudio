## Moai toolkit settings

- `moai = { entrypoints = { "main.lua", "source/main.lua" } }`: allows to set entrypoints that are used as "main" files for debugging.
The list of endpoints is checked against project files and if any file is matched, it will be used as a starting point for running or debugging the current project instead of the currently edited file.
