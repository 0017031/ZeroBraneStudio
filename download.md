## Upgrade warning for Mac OSX users.

If you are using Mac OSX version, please make sure to **save your ZeroBrane Studio system settings** (`Edit | Preferences | Settings: System`) before upgrading as those are saved inside the application folder and **will be lost** during the upgrade.
As an alternative, you can **move those system settings to user settings** (`Edit | Preferences | Settings: User`) as those are not affected by the upgrade process.
