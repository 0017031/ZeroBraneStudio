**Cross-platform**
Windows, Mac, or Linux: your choice.

**Portable**
Runs from any folder. No installation required.

**Calltip**
Quickly access function description or variable/expression values while debugging.

**Small**
With the windows installation package being less than 4M, it is one of the smallest if not _the smallest_ fully featured IDE.

**Configurable**
Tabs or spaces? 2 or 4? As everyone has its own preferences, ZeroBrane Studio gives you _sensible defaults_ and a way to change them.

**Debug any Lua application**
Set breakpoints before or after you start debugging. Break and continue your script. Step in, over, and out.

**Watch view**
The Watch view provides a convenient way to evaluate variables and expressions after every step of the debugger.

**Static analizer**
Detect typos, unused parameters, and non-localized variables before running your code.

**Multi-file editing**
Keep as many files open as you need and navigate them using the file browser or the editor tabs.

**Instantly usable**
Ever opened a new tool and didn't know where to start? ZeroBrane Studio provides _integrated lessons_ on how to use it and _over 50 demo scripts_ to get you started.

**Pretty printing**
If `for k,v in pairs(tbl) do print(k,v) end` works for you, you will not miss the integrated pretty printing of any value in a line or block form.

**Live coding**
Execute your application while you are typing it. Detect syntax and run-time errors quickly; change numeric parameters on the fly with sliders.

**Project file browser**
Don't worry about creating a new project, simply open a folder. The current file will be highlighted in the project tree (as long as it is in one of the subfolders).

**Stack view**
The Stack view provides not only the call stack with function names, but also presents all local variables and upvalues for each of the stack frames. You can even drill down to get values of individual elements in tables.

**Remote console**
Want to test something quickly? Run it in the console with full access to your application state and all variables; execute code fragments and change variable values without restarting your application.

**Custom intepreters**
Want to integrate ZeroBrane Studio with your own Lua engine? If none of the provided interpreters work for you, you can easily write your own as some of the users have done.
