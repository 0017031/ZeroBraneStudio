ZeroBrane Studio is a **lightweight Lua IDE** with code completion, syntax
highlighting, code analyzer, live coding, and debugging support
for Lua 5.1, [Lua 5.2](doc-lua52-debugging.html),
[LuaJIT](doc-luajit-debugging.html), and [other Lua engines](documentation.html#debugging).

It is **simple and instantly usable** for beginners (as tested with middle and
high school students with no programming experience), yet
**[feature-rich](features.html) and extensible** for experienced developers.
Unlike&nbsp;Eclipse and IntelliJ, it has a **small footprint** and is **completely customizable with Lua**.
Unlike&nbsp;TextMate and Sublime Text, it includes a **remote debugger** and a **full IDE feature set**.
Unlike&nbsp;Decoda, it runs on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux and supports **on-device debugging**.

ZeroBrane Studio also provides several unique features: **live coding** for
immediate feedback, **Markdown formatting** in comments for providing
instructions with minimal context switching, and **integrated interactive
materials** for those learning Lua or getting familiar with programming.

For those interested in **game and mobile development**, it supports debugging
for [Löve 2D](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/love2d-debugging),
[Moai](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/moai-debugging-with-zerobrane-studio),
[Gideros](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/gideros-debugging-with-zerobrane-studio-ide),
[Marmalade Quick](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/marmalade-quick-debugging-with-zerobrane-studio),
[Corona](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/debugging-and-live-coding-with-corona-sdk-applications-and-zerobrane-studio),
and [Cocos2d-x](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/cocos2d-x-simulator-and-on-device-debugging-with-zerobrane-studio).
