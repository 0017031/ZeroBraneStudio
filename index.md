ZeroBrane Studio is a **lightweight Lua IDE** with code completion, syntax
highlighting, remote debugger, code analyzer, live coding, and debugging
support for several Lua engines.

It is **simple and instantly usable** for beginners (as tested with middle and
high school students with no programming experience), yet
[feature-rich](features.html) and extensible for experienced developers.
Unlike Eclipse and IntelliJ, it has a **small footprint and is completely
customizable with Lua**. Unlike TextMate and Sublime Text, it includes a
**remote debugger** and a **full IDE feature set**.

ZeroBrane Studio also provides several unique features: **live coding** for
immediate feedback, **Markdown formatting** in comments for providing
instructions with minimal context switching, and **integrated interactive
materials** for those learning Lua or getting familiar with programming.

For those interested in **game and mobile development**, it supports debugging
for Löve 2D ([demo](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/love2d-debugging)),
Moai ([demo](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/moai-debugging-with-zerobrane-studio)),
Gideros ([demo](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/gideros-debugging-with-zerobrane-studio-ide)),
Marmalade Quick ([demo](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/marmalade-quick-debugging-with-zerobrane-studio)),
and Corona ([demo](debugging-and-live-coding-with-corona-sdk-applications-and-zerobrane-studio)).

## Feature highlights
