## What do I get?
You get packages for three platforms:
**Windows** XP or later (zip or self-extracting archive), **Mac OS X** 10.6.8+ (dmg file), or **Linux** (shell archive for Debian, Ubuntu, and Mint distributions).

## What if I want to try ZeroBrane Studio first?
You can proceed to the [download page](download.html?not-this-time); come back when you complete your evaluation and are ready to pay.

## How much do I pay?
This is completely up to you. How much do you value being able to find
an issue with your code in 5 minutes instead of 15? Get your mobile 
application out faster? Have fun helping your kids or friends learn
programming using Lua and examples included with the IDE?

## Isn't this an open source project?
Yes and we make it easy for you to get code from GitHub and
run it from a cloned copy or an archive. If you decide not to pay this time,
please consider spreading the word, contributing code,
helping with [fixes](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/issues)
or [documentation](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/tree/gh-pages),
and answering questions other users may have.

## What if I want a refund?
