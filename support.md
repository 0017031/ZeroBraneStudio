## What do I get?
You get access to packages for three platforms:
**Windows** XP or later (zip or self-extracting archive), **Mac OS X** 10.6.8+ (dmg file), or **Linux** (shell archive for Debian, Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Mint, ArchLinux, Fedora, Gentoo and other distributions).

## How much do I pay?
This is completely up to you. How much do you value being able to find
an issue with your code in 5 minutes instead of 15? Get your mobile 
application out faster? Have fun helping your kids or friends learn
programming using Lua and examples included with the IDE?

Your payment will help support future development of the IDE.

ZeroBrane LLC is not a tax-exempt non-profit organization, so your payment is **not tax deductible**.

## Isn't this an open source project?
Yes and we make it easy for you to get the code from GitHub and
run it from a cloned copy or an archive. We would still **appreciate your
payment in support of this project.** If you decide not to provide financial
support this time, please consider spreading the word, contributing code,
helping with [fixes](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/issues)
or [documentation](documentation),
and answering questions other users may have.
