([Nikita Dudnik](http://nikdudnik.com/post/30067678839/ive-spent-last-day-looking-for-a-suitable))

Love ZeroBrane Studio. **Lightweight. Works. Powerful.**
([Ross Berteig](http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2016-08/msg00500.html))

**I like ZBS for what it is**. I love it for where it is headed.
([Andrew Starks](https://github.com/andrewstarks))

I like your Lua IDE. It is **simple to use and has very good debugging features**.
([pwegscheider](https://github.com/pwegscheider))

It's a joy to use; compared to the debugger in Scite, ZBS is **totally rock solid**.
(Jeff Smith)

ZBS is beautiful experience. I am using it usually **10 hrs every day w/o problems**.
([Srdjan Markovic](https://github.com/srdjan-m))

Superb! ZeroBrane just became my **lua/moai IDE of choice**. Thanks for integrating MOAI debugging!
([Stu](http://www.tabletop-terrain.com/))

Thanks again for your awesome IDE. **I've moved over to it, forsaking my previous investment in Decoda**!
(Stephen Nichols)

I'd like to thank you for the Zerobrane IDE. **It is the best** (I've tested almost all of the competitors).
(Sandro Moreira)

Thanks for the best IDE out there! I really love it, **very simple, well organized, very robust**, it is a must.
(Dimitri Delattre)

What a **breath of fresh air**. After using for a couple of hours I went back and paid $24 and felt even better :-).
([doctorbling](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/zerobrane-studio-is-one-year-old#comment-186))

I like the **clean and simple interface**, and a quick test of the debug feature (step by step) shown it is well made.
([Philippe Lhoste](http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2012-06/msg00854.html))

Thank you for contributing such an excellent project. This is the **first truly useful Lua IDE for Mac** that I've found.
(Steve Weiss)

IMHO, ZBS is the **fastest, most-flexible, best-thought-out IDE AND Debugger I've used** since I began coding professionally in 1980.
([Michael Berlyn](https://twitter.com/MichaelBerlyn/status/825720539381637121))

Thanks a lot for such a wonderful IDE!  It's **really easy to use and has some unique features** especially compared to slooooow and cumbersome Eclipse.
([Arthur](https://github.com/toiffel))

Oh my god, it's really working! I can't believe this, **I can finally debug my game**. The multi-line output is awesome! Thanks so much!
(Matúš Koprda)

I love ZBS. **I use it for all of the work I've started doing in Lua** and even tossed it on my PortableApps installation for work while I'm in the office! This IDE is fantastic!
([Eddie Dover](https://github.com/EddieDover))

ZeroBrane Studio has got a **working debugger, full IDE feature set, small footprint, and is completely customizable in lua.**  You have no idea how excited I was to find this little gem!
([Jonathan Shieh](https://github.com/Odie))

It looks really awesome! It's **a lightweight IDE with everything to start getting productive with lua**!  It's much more preferable to some of the super heavy weight alternatives out there like Eclipse or IntelliJ.  Great stuff.
