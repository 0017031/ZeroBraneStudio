_ZeroBrane Studio for Vera_ is a **lightweight Lua integrated development environment** (IDE)
with **debugging support for [Vera](http://getvera.com/)**
home automation devices (also known as MiCasaVerde or MCV).

The IDE is **[simple](vera-getting-started) and instantly usable** for beginners,
yet **[feature-rich](vera-features) and extensible** for experienced developers.
It provides a **powerful editor** with code completion and syntax highlighting,
a **code analyzer** helpful in finding errros and typos,
and **advanced debugger** for debugging Lua **scripts**, **scene events**, and **plugins**
running on **Vera** and **VeraLite** devices.

Using the debugger, you can **set/remove breakpoints**,
**step through the code**,
**run Lua commands** and **update variables** in the Remote Console,
**view the call stack** using the Stack window,
**inspect variables** using tooltips and the Watch window,
and **upload files** to the device.

To save you time, _ZeroBrane Studio for Vera_ shows you the **results of `print` commands** during debugging, which minimizes the use of device log files.
If you still want to see the log content, it provides a convenient option to **download the log file** into a new editor window right in the IDE.

## Feature highlights

* Small, portable, and **cross-platform** (Windows, macOS, and Linux);
* **Integrated [debugger](vera-debugging)** for applications running locally or on Vera devices;
* **[Interactive console](vera-getting-started#console-window)** to test code snippets with local and remote execution;
* Ability to **[push files to the device](vera-getting-started#vera-functions)** and to **[retrieve log files](vera-getting-started#vera-functions)** from it;
* **[Auto-completion](vera-getting-started#autocomplete)** for functions, keywords, and **Luup API**, [documentation](vera-documentation), and [more](vera-features).
